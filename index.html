    <h3> Personal Statement</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>After several successful years in tech sales as a trainer in tech products, I am following my passion for technology <br/> 
        while developing professionally to become a software developer. I have been training both on a self-taught basis (HMTL, CSS, Python)<br/>
        as well as successfully completing a Software Engineering Bootcamp, where I became certified in cloud technology (Azure) <br/>
        and solidified my knowledge in Java (OOP, syntax, data types, variables, program structure, etc.). I am passionate about coding, <br/>
        feeling extremely motivated to break into the profession, and willing to work to prove it.</p>

    <p> My strong suits are a positive outlook, fast learning, attention to detail and growth mindset. I welcome the challenges that <br/>
        the role of Software Developer brings, as I am a curious person, love learning new things and solving problems. I am also excited<br/>
        about and confident that I couldbecome a productive member of the a software development team as I am an easy-going, yet professional<br/>
        person who gets on with everyone.</p>
